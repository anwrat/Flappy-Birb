# Flappy-Bird
A remake of the classic flappy bird in Unity<br><br>

---

### Note: Initializing the repo
I first made the repo in github containing .gitignore and .gitattributes, then I created a new project in my computer. To configure the project as github repo, the following steps were applied.<br>
1. Go inside the new created unity folder.
2. Type `git init` to initialize repo
3. `git remote add origin urlofrepository`
4. `git fetch origin`
5. `git merge origin/main --allow-unrelated-histories`
6. Then do git add and commit
7. `git branch -M main`
8. `git push -u origin main`
